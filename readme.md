# Randomized Score Data Generator

This project generates randomized score data for research, analysis, or testing purposes. The data is based on initial predefined values, with random adjustments applied to each score to simulate different variations. The dataset is structured in groups, and each score is slightly modified by adding a random value between -2 and +2.

## Features
- Generates randomized score data for two groups: `Gedächtnis_t0`, `Gedächtnis_t14`, `Konzentration_t0`, and `Konzentration_t14`.
- Provides a dataset with scores slightly altered to introduce variation for analysis or testing.
- Outputs the data in a text format, making it easy to use in various applications.

## Usage
To use this project, simply download or clone the repository, then open the `results.txt` file to see the generated data. The data is ready for use in any analysis or testing pipeline that requires randomized score data.

## How It Works
1. The project starts with an initial set of predefined scores.
2. Random adjustments between -2 and +2 are applied to each score to create variation.
3. The final dataset is saved in a `results.txt` file, which can be used for further analysis.

## AI Assistance
This project was created with the help of the **GPT-4 AI model** by OpenAI. The AI was instrumental in generating the randomized dataset by performing the necessary calculations and ensuring the data follows the required format.
